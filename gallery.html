                <div class="b-main__paragraph">
                    In the world of art the most expensive pieces get the most attention. Everybody is excited about the
                    “Mona Lisa” but not the next door painter's new piece. Our website's priority is to help our artists
                    promotes themselves and sell more of their art pieces.
                    <br><br>
                    Gallery '94 is based on a simple idea: Help to promote the local artists, help them sell their
                    products and introduce the news and events to the people who are not regulars

                <div class="b-main__paragraph">In terms of research we wanted to look to our competition first. We
                    picked ArtMajeur, Spacey, Bettershared as direct competitors and Lisson gallery as an indirect
                    competitor. We wanted to do a competitive analysis so we can compare their main features on the
                    site, and a SWOT analysis so we can see their strong and weak sides.
                    <br><br>
                    Then we wanted to set our main personas , find the key needs and frustrastions for them and make a
                    user flow and user journey to see how they react on our website. Lastly we wanted to set the website
                    architecture and create our structure so we can see all the pages in one place.

                <div class="b-main__paragraph">In terms of feature difference we discovered that our competitors are not
                    that different and use the same logic to show the product, with few different details in presenting
                    product card, some have artist location, some have price - directly on the product card ...
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of layout they all adapted the minimalist approach , they all had options for users to buy
                    without creating profile, more info on availability on product cards, and an advanced filter.
                    <br><br>
                    We had some negatives also , like not good structure specificly on homepage, too much white space ,
                    text too far from the image of the product, not clear what product goes to what category...

                    the website, search for product - buy it… but upon closer inspection the user research made clear
                    that there were divergent motivations and paths.
                    <br><br>
                    Creating personas helped bring some clarity to those differences, which would become important
                    reference points as functions developed.
                    <br><br>
                    As research and design proceeded, We focused primarily on two personas because they represented
                    heavy emphasis of two key functions: Regulars who search for new art products ; and artists who look
                    for new places to sell their art, buy decorations and look for events near them.

                    for a product it is a necessity to look for similar products. To ensure the user's flow - uncut, we

                    We managed to make these changes and be able to complete the flow for a more fully realized high

                    Placing the right information od product card is crucial, if you want the user to search faster and

                    The filter is the main feature for users that know what they want.

                    Having artist's info is helping the user to get familiar, find similar art and make the product more
