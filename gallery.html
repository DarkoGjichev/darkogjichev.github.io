      <p class="b-project__paragraph">In the world of art the most expencieve pieces get the most attention. Everybody
        is excited about the “Mona Lisa” but not the next door painter’s new piece. Our website’s priority is to help
        our artists promotes themself and sell more of their artpieces.
        <br><br> Gallery ‘94 is based on a simple idea: Help to promote the local artists, help them sell their products
        and introduce the news and events to the people who are not

          cards and a view all-cta to continue exploring in the same category.</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">In order to add items to wishlist you will need to register or login to the
          website but we managed to make it happen to users who wants to directly buy items without login, and by giving
          only the most important info so the payment can proceed.(meaning the website wont remember their info if they
          dont want to )</li>

      <h2 class="b-project__title">RESEARCH</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">In terms of research we wanted to look to our competition first. We picked
        ArtMajeur, Spacey, Bettershared as direct competitors and Lisson gallery as an indirect competitor. We wanted to
        do a competitive analysis so we can compare their main features on the site, and a SWOT analysis so we can see
        their strong and weak sides.
        <br><br>
        Then we wanted to set our main personas , find the key needs and frustrastions for them and make a user flow and
        user journey to see how they react on our website.
        Lastly we wanted to set the website architecture and create our structure so we can see all the pages in one
        place.

    </article>
    <article class="b-project__wrapper">
      <h4 class="b-project__subtitle">FINDINGS</h4>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">In terms of feature difference we discovered that our competitors are not that
        different and use the same logic to show the product, with few different details in presenting product card,
        some have artist location, some have price - directly on the product card ...
        <br><br>
        In terms of layout they all adapted the minimalist approach , they all had options for users to buy without
        creating profile, more info on availability on product cards, and an advanced filter.
        <br><br>
        We had some negatives also , like not good structure specificly on homepage, too much white space , text too far
        from the image of the product, not clear what product goes to what category...

      <h2 class="b-project__title">PERSONAS</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">At first, it might seem that everyone is experiencing the same flow on the
        website, search for product - buy it… but upon closer inspection the user research made clear that there were
        divergent motivations and paths.
        <br><br>
        Creating personas helped bring some clarity to those differences, which would become important reference points
        as functions developed.
        <br><br>
        As research and design proceeded, We focused primarily on two personas because they represented heavy emphasis
        of two key functions: Regulars who search for new art products ; and artists who look for new places to sell
        their art, buy decorations and look for events near them.

      <p class="b-project__paragraph">By creating and exploring the journey map and flow for the primary persona and
        their typical tasks, I uncovered key emotional/procedural moments that our website needed to address. The
        excitement someone might feel, when they visit the website. While searching for a product it is a necessity to
        look for similar products. To ensure the user's flow - uncut, we need to overcome these problems.</p>

      <p class="b-project__paragraph">This site map, organizationally shows the three key task that the high fidelity
        prototype would focus on:</p>
      <ul class="b-project__list">
        <li class="b-project__list--item">Onboard experience and navigation through main categories.</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">The journey to buy products and payment section.</li>

      <h2 class="b-project__title">LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">Sketching in FigJam allowed us to explore design patterns and similarities between
        pages, helping us to understand what we needed to implement in the layout of the website. It also helped us to
        to identify the types of pages that we have where we can use components, due to same layout so it would be
        quicker and easier to design them.</p>

      <h2 class="b-project__title">HIGH-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">Sketching allowed us to better understand how users expected to complete the tasks
        they needed to do on the website. By studying the flows we understand what needed to be changed and fixed for
        better experience.
        <br><br>
        We managed to make these changes and be able to complete the flow for a more fully realized high fidelity
        prototype. Small details such as actionable and consistent iconography, and consistent paths to get back, would
        become important elements of the design system.

      <p class="b-project__paragraph">After transforming the wireframes into pages with colors and images and apply our
        actual design we managed to make a prototype of all the pages of the website, and presented our solution to the
        client. Enjoy!</p>

        images and clear text; simple button states and clear iconography would help make tasks feel more manageable;
        and a single, modern sans-serif with large, open counters ensured legibility and clarity in describing the
