      <h2 class="b-project__title">OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">Vidivaka brings the most important news to your digital channels, providing timely, fair and honest
        information.This project was presented to us while we were students at the Brainster UX/UI Academy. The company
        wanted to redesign their website and desided to put the trust of doing that in students.</p>

      <h4 class="b-project__subtitle">STAKEHOLDER HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul class="b-project__list">
        <li class="b-project__list--item">The number of visits started to grow rapidly from mobile devices and they needed fully responsive website
          for both mobile and desktop aproach.</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">Usualy they post 5 to 7 posts weekly, so they wanted their homepage to be dynamic and to look diferent for
          their viewers (imagine visiting the site 3 days in a row and the same story pop-ups first).</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">The multimedia stories needed more storytelling.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>
    <article class="b-project__wrapper">
      <h4 class="b-project__subtitle">PROPOSED SOLUTIONS</h4>
      <ul class="b-project__list">
        <li class="b-project__list--item">We proposed that solution of this would be mobile first - approach, where we start designing the mobile
          version first and than we adapt the desktop version from the mobile version.</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">We wanted all of the stories from this week to be seen from onboarding.(at least for the desktop version.).
          The priority will be given to the newest article, with big image, then in the left container will be two more
          articles with smaller images, and last,containing the right container will be the oldest news from this week,
          supported only by text.</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">Vidivaka has unique way of telling stories. They have stories supported by text , video and podcast episodes
          so the reader can pick his way of listening. We suggested that the user should be presented with the
          opportunity to scroll directly to the video or podcast player so they can get there faster and start to listen
          or watch. The solution was adding buttons visible with onboarding on site who would scroll you down to the
          player depending on what you clicked.</li>
      </ul>

    <article class="b-project__wrapper">
      <h2 class="b-project__title">RESEARCH</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">During our stakeholder interview we talked about research that their team already conducted. They presented us
        with three target groups that they wanted the solution to be based on. The main target was the younger audience
        who were mainly users already but their numbers jumped high due to the websites authenticity of telling stories.
        The next ones were the older audience , mainly computer users who wanted to read about local stories, politics
        and also their comments about articles were increasing. The third group were the journalists who wanted unique
        way of re sharing the stories.
        <br><br>
        Next thing that we talked was their competition or websites that they looked up to.
        <br><br>
        They were thinking big, already having in mind websites like <b>The Guardian</b> and <b>NewYork Times</b> like
        some of the bigest websites in this field in the world, <b>NowThis</b>, <b>The Vox</b> were also websites that
        are worldwide famous and we added <b>Al Jazeera</b> in this list becouse of their ability to tell a story with
        videos, texts and also podcasts. From here we made a SWOT analysis of their pro's and con's and made a summary
        of what should our website learn from them.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article class="b-project__wrapper">
      <h4 class="b-project__subtitle">FINDINGS</h4>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">The first part of our research began at our competition. Firstly we made a SWOT analysis, so we can better see
        at their strengths and weaknesses and we can clearly highlight their threats going forward and make sure that we
        dont make the same mistakes. Also we tried to find opportunities from it by conducting a brainstorming sessions
        where each of us presented an idea for a new feature or how should we design some parts of the website.
        <br><br>
        We made a list with features that most of our competitors had in their websites and decided to compare them one
        to another to see which features are not consistent in their designs. We concluded and highlighted some the key
        features that we decided to go for and have a better experience for their users. We added <b>social links</b> ,
        <b>CTA button</b> for loading more news when you reach the end of a site (automatically more news seemed
        confusing and fast for our older audience), and we added <b>hashtags</b> because they helped the users for
        easily finding what the article is about and fast searching for other article similar to the said article.

      <h2 class="b-project__title">PERSONAS</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">After the research we decided that two personas could cover the majority of our users. As the main persona we
        choose the younger audience. Works from office , always wants to be in time with local news , regular
        subscribers so they wont lose any news. They are mainly phone users who use their phone every chance they can.
        The second persona is the older audience, people who mainly uses their personal computer for reading. They also
        want to read every news , they want to support the local journalists and website which they think have accurate
        news. Main part of their usage of the website is the comment section where they comment and communicate with
        each other.</p>

    <article class="b-project__wrapper">
      <h2 class="b-project__title">USER FLOW AND USER JOURNEY</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">Because its a newspaper website the user didn't have any complex flow or journey while on the website. They
        simply find an article read it and if they feel they have more time they will continue reading another etc. The
        flow that we wanted to cover was about the user who wanted to contribute to the website after reading an
        article. They will visit the website search for an article, they see a category they like, click on it, then see
        articles similar to one another , clicks on one , read them and at the end of the article there is a cta who
        leads them to card donations page. They chose their plan , choose their payment option, complete the form and it
        takes them to a thank you page. There you have a button that sends you back to homepage so you will be inspired
        to read another story and dont live the site.</p>

    <article class="b-project__wrapper">
      <h2 class="b-project__title">STRUCTURE</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">After conducting our research , next on the list was creating the structure of the website. The main logic was
        colorful homepage with blocks from every category of news. Next were links to pages who contain the main type of
        news , from all of those pages you could visit every article from said category. While you are on an article
        page you can visit article pages similar to this , or if you feel inspired you can access the form for sharing
        your story , you can contribute to the website or join our newsletter.</p>

      <h2 class="b-project__title">LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">Sketching in FigJam helped me to understand the patterns and layouts that i needed to follow so i can have
        consistency in the design. It also helped to identify the screens that were similar in the layout type and where
        i could reuse components so the design part would be much faster. </p>

    <article class="b-project__wrapper">
      <h2 class="b-project__title">HIGH-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">While the low fidelity wire-frames were fun and helped me understand the flow a lot i still needed an example
        in which the frames were more visual and more understanding. The high fidelity wire-frames gave me what i wanted
        exactly. I used lorem ipsum text for textboxes and one color filled squares for media such as video , image
        etc... This looked more understanding and visually adaptive.</p>

      <h2 class="b-project__title">DESIGN SYSTEM</h2>
      <p class="b-project__paragraph">We talked a lot about the design system on the stakeholder interviews and we concluded that they wanted the
        main
        colors to stay the same . About the fonts we wanted to types : 1. paragraphs font we choose Helvetica an open
        sans
        type of font with clear design easy to read and understand. For the titles we choose Uni neue, more styled type
        of
        font that catches the attention of the reader . We have a variety of icons that we used in the design. Part of
        them are for video and podcast player , or just for the accourdion menus or the main menu.</p>

      <p class="b-project__paragraph">While we were designing the project we had a few brainstorming session and we talked about insights and we
        wanted
        to present them what we think they should implement in the future.</p>
      <ul class="b-project__list">
        <li class="b-project__list--item">The header should contain more links with specific categories (best would be to see what are the categories
          that the users visit the most).</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">Ability to create a personal profile will be good for the younger audience because they can easily share to
          socials like that.</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">Due to security reasons and hate speech , they should switch the comments section from anonymous to profile
          commenting.</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">While its good to have podcast player on the website, the more experienced users, or to say the users who
          listen to podcast regularly might want to listen them on other platforms. The option to switch to another
          platform would be better for them.</li>

      <h4 class="b-project__subtitle">LESSONS LEARNED</h4>
      <ul class="b-project__list">
        <li class="b-project__list--item">This was my first full project presented by a real client, and also a first team project. During this time i
          found out that not everything is the same as it is told in books.</li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">As my first real project i wanted it to be perfect so i tried to implement every feature or idea that the
          client wanted to. I learned how important is to ask question about their idea of the project, their idea of
          the
          design and what path they wanted to follow. </li>
        <li class="b-project__list--item">The main part was how to communicate with each other. At the start everyone just informed the others what he
          is going to do and isolated to work. Then when we saw that we are not in sync and design cannot be done
          without
          communication, I kinda took the lead role. After finishing the research we were on the same page as how we
          would
          need to continue. It was fun !</li>
