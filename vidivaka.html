          Vidivaka brings the most important news to your digital channels, providing timely, fair and honest
          information.

          This project was presented to us while we were students at the Brainster UX/UI Academy. The company wanted to
          redesign their website and desided to put the trust of doing that in students.

          <li class="b-main__paragraph"><b>The number of visits started to grow rapidly from mobile devices and they
              needed fully responsive website for both mobile and desktop aproach
            </b></li>
          <li class="b-main__paragraph">We proposed that solution of this would be mobile first - approach, where we
            start designing the mobile version first and than we adapt the desktop version from the mobile version.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="b-main__list--item">
          <li class="b-main__paragraph"><b>Usually they post 5 to 7 posts weekly, so they wanted their homepage to be
              dynamic and to look different for their viewers ( imagine visiting the site 3 days in a row and the same
              story pop-ups first )
            </b></li>
          <li class="b-main__paragraph">We wanted all of the stories from this week to be seen from onboarding.(at least
            for the desktop version.). The priority will be given to the newest article, with big image, then in the
            left container will be two more articles with smaller images, and last,containing the right container will
            be the oldest news from this week, supported only by text.</li>

        <ul class="b-main__list--item">
          <li class="b-main__paragraph"><b>The multimedia stories needed more storytelling.</b>
          </li>
          <li class="b-main__paragraph">Vidivaka has unique way of telling stories. They have stories supported by text
            , video and podcast episodes so the reader can pick his way of listening. We suggested that the user should
            be presented with the opportunity to scroll directly to the video or podcast player so they can get there
            faster and start to listen or watch. The solution was adding buttons visible with onboarding on site who
            would scroll you down to the player depending on what you clicked.</li>

      <article class="b-main__text">
        <div class="b-main__title">Research</div>
        <div class="b-main__paragraph">During our stakeholder interview we talked about research that their team already
          conducted. They presented us with three target groups that they wanted the solution to be based on. The main
          target was the younger audience who were mainly users already but their numbers jumped high due to the
          websites authenticity of telling stories. The next ones were the older audience , mainly computer users who
          wanted to read about local stories, politics and also their comments about articles were increasing. The third
          group were the journalists who wanted unique way of re sharing the stories.
          <br><br>
          Next thing that we talked was their competition or websites that they looked up to.
          <br><br>

          They were thinking big, already having in mind websites like <b>The Guardian</b> and <b>NewYork Times</b> like
          some of the biggest websites in this field in the world, <b>NowThis</b>, <b>The Vox</b> were also websites
          that are worldwide famous and we added <b>Al Jazeera</b> in this list because of their ability to tell a story
          with videos, texts and also podcasts. From here we made a SWOT analysis of their pro's and con's and made a
          summary of what should our website learn from them.
        </div>
      </article>
      <article class="b-main__text">
        <div class="b-main__title">Findings</div>
        <div class="b-main__paragraph">The first part of our research began at our competition. Firstly we made a SWOT
          analysis, so we can better see at their strengths and weaknesses and we can clearly highlight their threats
          going forward and make sure that we dont make the same mistakes. Also we tried to find opportunities from it
          by conducting a brainstorming sessions where each of us presented an idea for a new feature or how should we
          design some parts of the website.
          <br><br>
          made a list with features that most of our competitors had in their websites and decided to compare them one
          to another to see which features are not consistent in their designs. We concluded and highlighted some the
          key features that we decided to go for and have a better experience for their users. We added social links ,
          CTA button for loading more news when you reach the end of a site (automatically more news seemed confusing
          and fast for our older audience), and we added hashtags because they helped the users for easily finding what
          the article is about and fast searching for other article similar to the said article.

        <div class="b-main__title">Building empathy</div>
        <div class="b-main__paragraph">After the research we decided that two personas could cover the majority of our
          users. As the main persona we choose the younger audience. Works from office , always wants to be in time with
          local news , regular subscribers so they wont lose any news. They are mainly phone users who use their phone
          every chance they can. The second persona is the older audience, people who mainly uses their personal
          computer for reading. They also want to read every news , they want to support the local journalists and
          website which they think have accurate news. Main part of their usage of the website is the comment section
          where they comment and communicate with each other.

        <div class="b-main__title">The flow and journey of the “every day” user</div>
        <div class="b-main__paragraph">Because its a newspaper website the user didn't have any complex flow or journey
          while on the website. They simply find an article read it and if they feel they have more time they will
          continue reading another etc. The flow that we wanted to cover was about the user who wanted to contribute to
          the website after reading an article. They will visit the website search for an article, they see a category
          they like, click on it, then see articles similar to one another , clicks on one , read them and at the end of
          the article there is a cta who leads them to card donations page. They chose their plan , choose their payment
          option, complete the form and it takes them to a thank you page. There you have a button that sends you back
          to homepage so you will be inspired to read another story and don't live the site.

        <div class="b-main__paragraph">After conducting our research , next on the list was creating the structure of
          the website. The main logic was colorful homepage with blocks from every category of news. Next were links to
          pages who contain the main type of news , from all of those pages you could visit every article from said
          category. While you are on an article page you can visit article pages similar to this , or if you feel
          inspired you can access the form for sharing your story , you can contribute to the website or join our
          newsletter.

        <div class="b-main__paragraph">Sketching helped me to understand the patterns and layouts that i needed to
          follow so i can have consistency in the design. It also helped to identify the screens that were similar in
          the layout type and where i could reuse components so the design part would be much faster.

          lot i still needed an example in which the frames were more visual and more understanding. The high fidelity
          wire-frames gave me what i wanted exactly. I used lorem ipsum text for textboxes and one color filled squares
          for media such as video , image etc... This looked more understanding and visually adaptive.

        <div class="b-main__paragraph">We talked a lot about the design system on the stakeholder interviews and we
          concluded that they wanted the main colors to stay the same . About the fonts we wanted to types : 1.
          paragraphs font we choose Helvetica an open sans type of font with clear design easy to read and understand.
          For the titles we choose Uni neue, more styled type of font that catches the attention of the reader . We have
          a variety of icons that we used in the design. Part of them are for video and podcast player , or just for the
          accordion menus or the main menu.

          talked about insights and we wanted to present them what we think they should implement in the future.
          <br>
          <b>1.</b> The header should contain more links with specific categories (best would be to see what are the
          categories that the users visit the most).
          <br>
          <b>2.</b> Ability to create a personal profile will be good for the younger audience because they can easily
          share to socials like that.
          <br>
          <b>3.</b> Due to security reasons and hate speech , they should switch the comments section from anonymous to
          profile commenting.
          <br>
          <b>4.</b> While its good to have podcast player on the website, the more experienced users, or to say the
          users who listen to podcast regularly might want to listen them on other platforms. The option to switch to
          another platform would be better for them.

        <div class="b-main__title">LESSONS LEARNED</div>
        <div class="b-main__paragraph">This was my first full project presented by a real client, and also a first team
          project. During this time i found out that not everything is the same as it is told in books.
          <br><br>
          As my first real project i wanted it to be perfect so i tried to implement every feature or idea that the
          client wanted to. I learned how important is to ask question about their idea of the project, their idea of
          the design and what path they wanted to follow.
          <br><br>
          The main part was how to communicate with each other. At the start everyone just informed the others what he
          is going to do and isolated to work. Then when we saw that we are not in sync and design cannot be done
          without communication, I kinda took the lead role. After finishing the research we were on the same page as
          how we would need to continue. It was fun !
